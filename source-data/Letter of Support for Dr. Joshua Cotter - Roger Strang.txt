9/23/24To whom it may concern,My name is Roger and I am an instructional designer with Academic Technology Services (ATS).  IÕd like to express my gratitude to Dr. Joshua Cotter for collaborating with ATS to share his online teaching expertise with the campus via our Faculty Online Readiness Program (FORP) workshops.  Workshops Dr. Cotter co-facilitated with ATS:- Online Course Design Best Practices (4/7/23)- Online Course Design Best Practices (3/12/24)In Online Course Design Best Practices, Dr. Cotter shared a teaching activity called Process Oriented Guided Inquiry Learning (POGIL) with about 20 workshop participants.  He demonstrated how POGIL is a collaborative and well-structured activity for students, goals that participants appreciate.  Moreover, Dr. Cotter brainstormed and provided input into the aspects of the workshop that I presented.  He was a pleasure to work with.  I fully support Dr. Cotter being promoted to full Professor.  If you have any questions for me, please do not hesitate to contact me or my department.Sincerely,Roger StrangRoger.strang@csulb.eduAcademic Technology Services - ATS-InstructionalDesign@csulb.edu
